## How to run this project




To run this project, you need docker installed on your device.
Doker is a tool that helps to keep any project in its environment anywhere.


if you do not have docker in your device you can follow these guides based on your device OS:


- [Linux Docker installing guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- [Windows Docker installing guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)


So after successfully installing docker to your machine, now you will clone this project to your machine as following:
```bash
$ git clone  https://github.com/AbdulxaqDev/green-api.git
```




And, you just run following command in terminal (make sure you in correct directory, which is you cloned project):


```bash
$ docker compose up -d
```


Then, your terminal print some fancy stuff like following

Amazing, we have done setup, now turn is to try running the application.






First you should understand the logic of this project, the login is as following


![image](./task_requirements/scheme.png)


As you can see we need to do HTTP requests and the project does the same work. To send HTTP request you need [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)


You can any send request from Postman's web version as following to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```
![image](./desvription_img/postman.png)


So, with HTTP, we need to send post request with following payload:


```json
{
    "message": "Hello ..."
}
```
So you can send any kind of text. But, the dots have special meaning for this application.


For every dot, the application is got paused for one second on the M2 microserver.


If you send
```json
{
    "message": "Hello ..."
}
```
string with HTTP post request,
M1 microserver sends it to M2 microserver through RabbitMQ (AMQP). Then M2 converts message to something like this:
```json
{
    "message": "Hello ###"
}
```
And, the M2 is paused for a second for each dot. This is just a simulation of processing.


It can do image processing or pdf, any kind of processing.
